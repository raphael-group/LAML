# sc-MAIL: single-cell Maximum-likelihood Ancestral Inference for Lineage-tracing

sc-MAIL is a maximum likelihood algorithm under the Probabilistic Mixed-type Missing (PMM) model. Given a lineage tracing experiment character matrix with heterogeneous per-site alphabets and mutation probabilities, sc-MAIL will find a maximum likelihood tree topology and estimate branch lengths as well as stochastic dropout and heritable silencing missing data rates. 

For additional information about the method, you can refer to the [website](https://raphael-group.github.io/sc-mail/).
# Precursors (required before installation)

We ask that users use python >= 3.6 with our code. 

## MOSEK License
1. First, we ask users to set up a MOSEK license. The preferred option is to place the license file mosek.lic in the directory mosek in the userâ€™s home directory. Please refer to the MOSEK installation page [here](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/).
2. (Optional): If you decide to add the license file elsewhere, please add the license file to your path by adding an environment variable. For instance, add the following line to your `.bashrc` and load (`source ~/.bashrc` for Linux/Unix and `. ~/.bashrc` for Windows). [This page](https://docs.mosek.com/latest/licensing/client-setup.html) may be useful to reference.

```
export MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE=<path_to_folder_containing_mosek_license>
```

# Installation
If you've fulfilled the required precursor steps, you can pick one of two ways to install sc-MAIL. We recommend installing using `pip`, but you can also install from source.

### Install using pip (recommended)

0. Please set up the MOSEK license. 

1. sc-MAIL is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). To install, use `pip` as follows:
```
pip install scmail"
```
This will install the scmail package to your default package location. If you would like to specify a separate installation location, you can use the flag: `--prefix="<your_preferred_install_dir>`, then set this prefix in your PATH and PYTHONPATH (see below for help).

If `pip` installs the package in a directory which is not on path, `pip` will throw a warning and ask the user to consider adding this directory to PATH. This should be heeded (see below for help).

2. If you open a python interpreter as follows:

```
$ python
Python 3.9.16 (main, Sep 12 2023, 00:00:00)
[GCC 11.3.1 20221121 (Red Hat 11.3.1-4)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import scmail_libs
>>>
```

You can now import functions from `scmail_libs`.

3. You can also run the following:

```
run_scmail
```
to see the commandline help of sc-MAIL.

## Install from source

0. Set up the MOSEK license file. See above (section Precursors).

1. Please clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/raphael-group/sc-mail.git
```

2. Run the setup script from inside the sc-mail directory. 
```
cd sc-mail
python setup.py install 
```
You can (for example, if you are running on a server and get permission denied when you try to install it in the default location), run it with `--prefix=<your_preferred_install_dir>` but be sure to set this prefix to your preferred PYTHONPATH (see below for help).

After installation, run:

```
run_scmail -h
```
to see the commandline help of sc-MAIL.

## (Optional) Testing

Please run the unit tests with:

```
$ scmail_tests.py 
```
You can also run it with
```
$ python scmail_tests.py 
```
from inside the `sc-mail/` directory.

This will print `Running tests for sc-MAIL...` to begin, and print progress dots (one for each test passed). 
At the end, it should print:
```
Running tests for sc-MAIL...
....................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 68 tests in 95.651s

OK
```
The lightweight test suite runs in ~1.5 minutes on my Linux machine.



## (optional) Setting prefix in environment variable 

To set the prefix `<your_preferred_install_dir>` in your PATH and PYTHONPATH, follow these steps:

(Unix/Linux users) In a Terminal:
```
vi ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:<your_preferred_install_dir>"
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<your_preferred_install_dir>"
```

<!--export PATH=$PATH/pkgs/scmail-0.5-py311_0/bin:<your_preferred_install_dir>"-->
(Windows users) In a Command Prompt or PowerShell:
```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:<your_preferred_install_dir>"
setx PYTHONPATH "%PYTHONPATH%;C:<your_preferred_install_dir>"
```

For both users, be sure to restart any applications or shells you want to use the updated PATH variable.


# Usage

If you downloaded using `pip` or `conda`, you should download the examples from github from [examples.zip](https://github.com/raphael-group/sc-mail/tree/master/examples.zip), unzip it, and run each command below from the directory containing this examples folder. If you downloaded from source, you can run `run_scmail` after the setup.

Although there are many more options available, sc-MAIL only strictly requires three arguments, using the following command:
```
$ run_scmail -t <topology> -c <characters> -o <output> 
```

The output consists of three files: 

1. `<prefix>_annotations.txt`: this file contains the inferred maximum likelihood sequences for all internal nodes and leaf nodes, with possible characters and associated probabilities for sites with more than one possibility.
2. `<prefix>_params.txt`: this file contains the dropout rate, silencing rate, and negative log likelihood.
3. `<prefix>_trees.nwk`: this file contains the rooted estimated tree with branch lengths.
4. (optional) `<prefix>._ckpt.<randomnumber>.txt`: this file contains checkpoints in the topology search process.


## Examples

Note that if you get an error in trying the following commands (especially use case 3), please make sure you have set up the MOSEK license file.

### Use Case 1: Infer branch lengths on a topology

From the `sc-mail/` directory, please run the following code:
```
$ run_scmail -c examples/character_matrix.csv -t examples/starting.tree -p examples/priors.csv --delimiter comma -o example1 --nInitials 1 --randseeds 1984
```

This will output three files (`example1_annotations.txt`, `example1_params.txt`, `example1_trees.nwk`). You can compare these outputs with those in `examples/out_example1/`. For instance, in order to compare the likelihoods, display the contents of the two files using the following (if on Linux/Unix):
```
$ cat example1_params.txt
$ cat examples/out_example1/example1_params.txt
```
or (if on Windows in Command Prompt):
```
$ type example1_params.txt examples/out_example1/example1_params.txt
```


### Use Case 2: Compute the likelihood of an existing tree

From the `sc-mail/` directory, please run the following code:
```
$ run_scmail -c examples/character_matrix.csv -t examples/starting.tree -p examples/priors.csv --delimiter comma -o example2 -L "0 4.879273344239771e-07" --solver Scipy
```

This will output three files (`example2_annotations.txt`, `example2_params.txt`, `example2_trees.nwk`). You can compare these outputs with those in `examples/out_example2/`. For instance, in order to compare the likelihoods, display the contents of the two files using the following (if on Linux/Unix):
```
$ cat example2_params.txt
$ cat examples/out_example2/example2_params.txt
```
or (if on Windows in Command Prompt):
```
$ type example2_params.txt examples/out_example2/example2_params.txt
```

### Use Case 3: Infer a topology

From the `sc-mail/` directory, please run the following code:
```
$ run_scmail -c examples/character_matrix.csv -t examples/starting.tree -p examples/priors.csv --delimiter comma -o example3 --nInitials 1 --randomreps 1 --topology_search -v --ultrametric --parallel
```

This will output four files (`example3_annotations.txt`, `example3_params.txt`, `example3_trees.nwk`, `example3._ckpt.<randnumber>.txt`). When performing topology search, a checkpoint file is also generateed. Note that this command will resolve all polytomies, run in parallel, and return an ultrametric tree.

You can compare these outputs with those in `examples/out_example3/`. For instance, in order to compare the likelihoods, display the contents of the two files using the following (if on Linux/Unix):
```
$ cat example3_params.txt
$ cat examples/out_example3/example3_params.txt
```
or (if on Windows in Command Prompt):
```
$ type example3_params.txt examples/out_example3/example3_params.txt
```
