Launching LAML version 0.0.4
LAML was called as follows: ../../run_laml.py -c character_matrix.csv -t starting.tree -p priors.csv -o example2_fastEM_cpu --nInitials 1 --randomreps 1 --topology_search -v --solver fastEM-cpu --timescale 10
JAX version: 0.4.30
Using JAX backend with [CpuDevice(id=0)] devices.
Using device TFRT_CPU_0 for computation.
Note that XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE is set to TRUE by default, so that recorded memory may not be accurate.
No polytomy detected.
